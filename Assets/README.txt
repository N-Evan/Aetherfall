So, I took a slightly different approach to the assignment. Instead of following a complete game development tutorial series from start to finish, I watched a bunch of them and tried my best to make it all work together. For starters, YouTube channels such as Brackey's, Game Maker's Toolkit, Samyam, Jason Weimann, CodeMonkey, and many others have been very informative and helpful throughout the start of my journey. 

First, I watched through this tutorial by Game Maker's Toolkit to get a feel of the Unity Editor.

This tutorial also gave me a good idea of the basic scripting procedures with C# for Unity. Afterward, I watched quite a few videos of Code Monkey, a prominent figure for Unity developers out there. His videos have helped me understand so many complex systems and processes with such ease. I watched too many videos from this channel to link all of them. I will be linking his channel instead.

After that, I sat down to plan out what I wanted to make. The first thought that came to mind is something like a Fantasy-RPG (Role Playing Game). I have always enjoyed RPGs despite their complexities, however, this felt like a great opportunity. So, for my game, Aetherfall, I have thought of a fantasy village with vast meadows around it to start. (I am working on a short story for this that I hope to complete by the end of this term and implement it in the game.) I quickly booted up Blender to make some basic blocks out of the town and landscape I envisioned. Prior knowledge of Blender basics helped me out a lot here, although the same could have been achieved just by using the primitives inside Unity but I felt more at home with Blender for the moment. 

With blockout blocks in place, I needed to start thinking of my player character and his controller. RPGs are often seen to be played in the third person, so now I need to figure out how to make a third-person controller. This task would also require me to take input from the player to move the player in the desired direction as well as give them the ability to look around the fantastic blocky landscape that I have built so far. 

After some quick googling about third-person character controllers, I came across several videos from many great instructors, each taking its different paths but eventually leading to a good feeling about third-person controllers. After trying out what I learned from them on my own, I came up with a character controller that lets me smoothly move around in this magnificent open world. I also had to solve how I would read player inputs from both keyboard-mouse & controllers. "Samyam" has some wonderful videos about these. Those are so easy to understand and implement. I am linking some of the videos that I watched to get to this stage.

At this point, I must mention that the way the "Input System" works in Unity is amazing. It saves from the tedious task of writing chunks of code manually from different input devices, input processing, and modifiers. Most of the tutorials seemed to use this package and it was a fun experience for me to learn it as well. Fortunately, most of the tutorials recommended and used a Cinemachine camera which has great features compared to the vanilla Unity Camera component. The learning curve with Cinemachine was not that difficult but once I got the hang of it, it was a breeze. 

As for the last few touches I wanted to add before marking the end of 0.0.1-alpha, I wanted to have some placeholder UI assets. I made a health bar, a mana bar, and a power-up circle at the top left of my HUD. While these UI elements are placeholder for now, they will be functional in the upcoming updates, I assure you. I also added a small panel to the left to show the basic controls available for the players at the moment. Last but not least, what good is a game without a main menu to start it? So with a screenshot of the blockout scene, I drafted a quick main menu scene from where players will be able to start or exit the game. Handling the UI components was not much hassle since all the introductory and beginner videos I watched helped me out a lot. This also accounts for scene switching. 

I do regret not adding any sort of Audio in the game so far, however, finding free-to-use and good-sounding audio from the get-go wasn't easy. I am still actively looking for Audio clips that I will be incorporating into the game in the future. 

With the basic foundation of my very own game in place, I felt relieved to have come so far in such a short time thanks to the wonderful educational resources available online. Since I am not following any complete tutorial but rather a collection of tutorials, I am using the knowledge from the tutorials along with my own skills to make modifications as I continue.
